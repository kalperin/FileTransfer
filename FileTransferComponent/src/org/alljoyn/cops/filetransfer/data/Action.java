/**
 * The action class defines the different action types that tell the
 * Transmitter which action needs to be taken. This class defines an
 * enumerated type that defines 10 different actions. This class
 * also includes an array of objects because different actions require
 * different parameters to execute the action and the data types vary
 * dramatically. Lastly, the action object contains a variable for peer.
 * This variable tells the Transmitter who to send the signal to or
 * perform a method call on their proxy bus object.
 * <p>
 * Note: the peer will be set to null only when a global signal will
 * be sent to all session peers.
 * <p> 
 * Note: This class is not intended to be used directly. All of the supported
 * functionality of this library is intended to be accessed through the
 * {@link org.alljoyn.cops.filetransfer.FileTransferComponent} class.
