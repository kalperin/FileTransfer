/**
 * The File Status object is used by the File Transfer Manager and the File
 * Receive Manager to monitor the progress of files that are being sent and
 * received. From the senders perspective, the file status will show the file
 * ID of the file being transferred, the length of the file, the peer to send
 * the file to, how many bytes have already been sent, and the maximum chunk
 * length specified by the receiver. From the receivers perspective, all of 
 * same data is monitored by the receiver with a few additions. The receiver
 * also keeps track of the save file name and the save file path. This is 
 * essential so the file chunks can be appended to the correct file.  
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is not intended to be used directly. All of the supported
 * functionality of this library is intended to be accessed through the
 * {@link org.alljoyn.cops.filetransfer.FileTransferComponent} class.
